#### Hey there!

My name is Daniel Maksymow. I am C/C++ Software Developer in Automotive department. I was studying Computer Science, specifically concetrating in
Linux, low level Software Engineering.

Linux is my first love but then I enrich my engeener tools with C/C++ development skills. And I've worked in several other laguages like Python, Ruby, Perl. Especially Perl6 is one of my favorite scripting language. I want to describe here my personal impressions of things which I usually do for everyday. Also my personal views for non technical staff would be placed here.

I will be happy when one day someone will look here and read at least one post and find something valuable for himself. If so please left me your feedback.
