      <description>Building Kernel with default x86_64 configuration  create default kernel build configuration using existing defconfig  make ARCH=x86 x86_64_defconfig The file .config is created in linux root directory. It can be still modified with
make menuconfig  build kernel image  make -j8 As a result we obtain a vmlinux binary which is a stand-alone monolithic ELF image. This binary contains no unresolved external refeces. Despite this file was found at the top-level kernel directory.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s the first test blog post. I decided to reuse an already popular static page generator called Hugo. It is written in Go and it was quite easy to dive into without any experience in Go.
Useful Hugo commands  run server and build draft posts  hugo server -D  create new post in content directory  hugo create posts/new_post.md Enjoy!</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Daniel Maksymow. I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced C/C++ Developer from Poland. I like to chat with the people, discuss my ideas, and talk a lot about my work. I think getting the opinion about yourself could be sometimes good or bad but it is part of the process which allows me to improve myself. On the other side, it is a great pleasure for me to share solutions for the problems which I encounter and describe there especially if they are described already but for any reason, there were not as good explained as I wonder.</description>
