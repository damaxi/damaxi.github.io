      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s the first test blog post. I decided to reuse an already popular static page generator called Hugo. It is written in Go and it was quite easy to dive into without any experience in Go.
Enjoy!</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Daniel Maksymow. I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced C/C++ Developer from Poland. I like to chat with the people, discuss my ideas, and talk a lot about my work. I think getting the opinion about yourself could be sometimes good or bad but it is part of the process which allows me to improve myself. On the other side, it is a great pleasure for me to share solutions for the problems which I encounter and describe there especially if they are described already but for any reason, there were not as good explained as I wonder.</description>
